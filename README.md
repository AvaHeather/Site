#___ Trans-Life ___#


The content on this site is and will initially be tailored around Trans related topics. A sort of one stop guide site for anyone questioning or transitioning 
or looking to understand trans related issues in their journey. 

 I have tried to fight alot of all that holds me back.. i've transitioned ,but my life was and isn't my own .i have had a good run since my transition,i've given my best efforts. So maybe this is the last work on this computer i'll ever have or a beginning but i write this message to prepare for whatever outcome . If someone finds the code on this site useful to their journey, please use it. 

i would have loved to know all this code i've written and learned for months will help someone out there,i'm not an expert and these lines of code gave me strength and helped me learn problem solving and helped me dream even for a short while. I do hope this finally could help Someone like my old self, when i could have needed this before i became damaged by this life. Growing up does that to you. Earth is a sick place to be, no matter what you do, there is no truth here, nothing is real.. maybe for me but i hope someone makes or gets a better place in their lives through this



i have tried. So if this is my last message, please let it get to help someone or link it to someone to finish developing it.

Site is still under progress.







incase of any inquiries about the code if im still around find me at:
